# Vehicle_speed_estimator-using-python
This Python project detects vehicles in a video using the YOLOv8 object detection model and estimates their speed based on their movement between frames. It‚Äôs a practical demonstration of real-time vehicle tracking and rough speed approximation using computer vision.

üéØ Features
-Detects and tracks vehicles (default: cars) in video

-Estimates speed in km/h using bounding box displacement

-Annotates bounding boxes with speed and object IDs

-Uses YOLOv8 from Ultralytics

-Works on pre-recorded video footage

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

-Python 3.8+

-Ultralytics YOLO

-OpenCV

-NumPy

Install dependencies:

pip install ultralytics opencv-python

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.Clone this repository.

2.Place a sample vehicle video in the project folder and update the path in vehicle_speed.py.

3.Run the script:

python vehicle_speed.py

4.Press q to stop the video.
