# Vehicle_speed_estimator-using-python
This Python project detects vehicles in a video using the YOLOv8 object detection model and estimates their speed based on their movement between frames. Itâ€™s a practical demonstration of real-time vehicle tracking and rough speed approximation using computer vision.
